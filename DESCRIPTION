Description: The package implements GUIDE-seq analysis workflow
        including functions for obtaining unique cleavage events,
        estimating the locations of the cleavage sites, aka, peaks,
        merging estimated cleavage sites from plus and minus strand,
        and performing off target search of the extended regions around
        cleavage sites.
